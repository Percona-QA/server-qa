"""Scenario setup/config layer for the binlog_server fetch/pull streaming
tests.

Lives in pbs/ (not tests/) alongside servers.py and util.py, the other
two shared framework modules -- tests/ holds only the test scripts
themselves and their own optional *_test.config files. Each test script
adds pbs/ to sys.path (see any test's own top) before importing this.

Test config loading and validation, generating the binlog_server
main_config.json, the shared ./logs layout, and the argparse flags common
to every test all live here, on top of servers.py's process wrapper
classes. This is also where ScenarioRunner lives: the base class that
owns the setup/teardown lifecycle every test shares (load config, start
the server, prepare sysbench data, and -- no matter how the scenario
exits -- stop any still-running background sysbench/pull process, then
the server, then log where the logs were preserved). Each test's own
scenario class overrides just `scenario()` with its test-specific steps;
see each script's own module docstring for what it tests:
gtid_rewrite_test.py, nogtid_norewrite_test.py, rewrite_mode_transition_test.py,
pull_restart_resilience_test.py, pull_purge_resume_test.py,
binlog_event_diversity_test.py.

basedir, binlog_server_bin, and storage backend/S3 settings come from a
JSON test config file (--config, default: config.json in pbs/), not from
command-line flags; when its "s3" section has no
"bucket" set, storage defaults to local file-backed storage. "encryption"
(unset/""/0/false/"0" all mean disabled) turns on storage.encryption, with
"encryption_kek_id"/"encryption_cipher" as optional overrides for
generate_config.py's own --encryption defaults; a keyring file is
auto-created under ./logs the first time it's needed, with
"keyring_file_cipher" (default AES-128-ECB, see DEFAULT_KEYRING_FILE_CIPHER)
as an optional override for the cipher *that keyring file's own generated
key* is recorded under -- unrelated to "encryption_cipher", which is the
cipher binlog_server uses to encrypt binlog data. Test logs, the
generated main_config.json, binsrv.log, the mysqld datadir, and storage
all live under ./logs (relative to the directory the test is run from) --
specifically ./logs/binsrv_data (local storage), ./logs/binsrv_tmp
(fs_buffer_directory, used for the S3 backend), and
./logs/keyring_data.json. ./logs is cleared and recreated at the start of
each run.
