"""Runner for the percona-binlog-server QA test suite under tests/.

Runs one or more of the standalone tests/*.py scripts -- the same way a
user would invoke one directly -- either sequentially or across a small
pool of parallel workers, and reports a pass/fail summary.

Test selection: --tests (alias --test) takes a comma-separated list, e.g.
--tests=gtid_rewrite_test,pull_purge_resume_test. A name not already
ending in ".py" has ".py" appended (so "gtid_rewrite_test" and
"gtid_rewrite_test.py" both resolve to tests/gtid_rewrite_test.py); a name
that already ends in ".py" is used as-is, with nothing appended. Every
named test must exist under tests/ as its own script (util.py, servers.py,
and setup.py -- the shared framework modules every test imports -- live
in pbs/ itself, not under tests/, and are rejected by name even if
someone types one) -- if any doesn't, the run fails immediately, before
anything is executed, reporting every name that could not be found.
--tests=all (or any name list that includes "all") runs every *_test.py
script under tests/, same as --run-all-tests below.

--run-all-tests runs every *_test.py script under tests/ regardless of
--tests/--test -- whether it was given at all, and regardless of what
value it was given. Either --tests/--test or --run-all-tests must be
given.

Sequential (--parallel not given, or given as 0 -- "parallel not set"):
tests run one after another, all sharing --log-dir itself as their
working directory (each test's own setup_scenario() wipes/recreates
./logs there at the start of its own run) -- not one permanent
subdirectory per test, which would otherwise pile up indefinitely as
more tests get added, most of it for tests that passed and left nothing
worth keeping.

Parallel (--parallel=N, clamped to [1, 4] -- 1 is the minimum once
parallel mode is on, 4 the maximum regardless of how high N is):
up to N tests run concurrently across worker slots w1..wN under
--log-dir. Each slot is a working directory reused across the run: as
soon as a test occupying a slot finishes, the next queued test claims
that slot (and thus that slot's ./logs, including the mysqld datadir
under ./logs/data) for its own run.

In both modes, a test's working directory (--log-dir itself in
sequential mode, w<N> in parallel mode) is reused by whichever test runs
there next. Because of that, a failing test's ./logs and its own
per-test log file are copied to <working-dir>/failed_logs/<test-name>/
before that directory is reused -- otherwise the next test to run there
would wipe/overwrite that evidence before anyone could look at it. This
copy is best-effort and never affects the test's recorded result; its
path (when there is one) is included in the console summary and
summary.json.

-e/--encryption forces storage encryption on for every test in this run,
regardless of the "encryption" setting in the test config file (it only
turns encryption on; it never turns it off if the config file already has
it on). This is done by writing a copy of the config file with
"encryption" forced to 1 under --log-dir and pointing every test at that
copy via --config; without -e, each test is pointed at --config (or its
own default) unmodified.

Each test's own console output is captured to a per-run log file rather
than streamed live -- with parallel workers, interleaved live output from
multiple tests would be unreadable. Tail a specific test's log file for a
live view of that test while the run is in progress. A machine-readable
summary.json is also written to --log-dir, and everything this runner
itself prints to the console (not each test's own captured output) is
also copied to test_runner.log there.
