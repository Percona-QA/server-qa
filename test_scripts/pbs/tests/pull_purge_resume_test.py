"""pull kill -> purge_binlogs -> resume test for percona-binlog-server.

With continuous sysbench load running and `pull` streaming concurrently,
repeats the following `--iterations` (default 10) times:

  1. Let `pull` run for a random `--kill-wait-min-seconds` to
     `--kill-wait-max-seconds` and then kill it (SIGKILL, simulating a
     crash rather than a graceful stop).
  2. `purge_binlogs` everything except the single most recent (tail)
     record. `purge_binlogs <config> <name>` purges `[oldest, name]`
     *inclusive* and refuses to purge the current tail (there must always
     be at least one record left to resume from), so "purge all but the
     latest" means passing the *second-to-last* record's name, not the
     last one; if fewer than 2 records exist yet, the purge is skipped for
     that iteration (logged, not a failure) and the cycle still runs
     kill+restart. After purging, verifies exactly one record remains.
  3. Restart `pull` and verify it actually resumes receiving *new* binlogs
     (storage byte size growing beyond its post-purge baseline), plus that
     `search_by_gtid_set` covers everything generated since the restart.
     Coverage is checked with `GTID_SUBTRACT(@@GLOBAL.gtid_executed,
     <tail's previous_gtids>)`, not the server's full historical GTID set
     -- the whole point of the purge is that older history is gone, so
     asking storage to still cover it would be checking the wrong thing.

Once all iterations finish, the background sysbench run is awaited, `pull`
is stopped gracefully (SIGTERM), and a final `search_by_gtid_set` (using
the same GTID_SUBTRACT approach against the final tail) confirms
completeness.

GTID mode, no rewrite (rewrite would change file naming/chunking; this
test is about resuming after purge_binlogs, not about naming). basedir,
binlog_server_bin, and storage settings come from --config (default:
config.json in pbs/), not from command-line flags.
--max-binlog-size defaults to 4096 bytes -- mysqld's documented minimum --
so the server rotates aggressively and multiple binlog files accumulate
quickly, giving every iteration a real, multi-file purge to exercise
instead of "nothing yet" or a single file.

--resume-timeout is not a flag: it's always --kill-wait-max-seconds + 80,
computed fresh each run, so it scales automatically with whatever
--kill-wait-max-seconds (or its pull_purge_resume_test.config override,
see below) ends up being -- a longer kill-wait window means more backlog
can build up while pull is dead, so the resume/catch-up budget needs to
grow with it rather than being tuned separately.

An optional pull_purge_resume_test.config file next to this script (a
flat "key=value" file, blank lines and "#" comments ignored) can override
two of the defaults above -- unset, empty, or 0 for either key just keeps
the CLI default, and an explicit --iterations/--kill-wait-max-seconds on
the command line always wins over both:

  number_of_iterations=<n>   overrides --iterations.
  max_pull_time=<seconds>    overrides --kill-wait-max-seconds.
